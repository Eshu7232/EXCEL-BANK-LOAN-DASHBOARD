## 📝 Project Design
Before creating the final dashboard, I created a **Design Sheet** in Excel to plan:
- Layout structure (KPI cards, charts, filters, icons).
- Color scheme and formatting.
- Placement of slicers and visuals.

This step ensured:
- A clear and professional structure.
- Faster dashboard creation.
- A clean storytelling flow.
